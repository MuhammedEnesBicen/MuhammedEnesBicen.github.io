  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Vocab: Vocabulary Feed</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 2025 December</p>

  <h2>1. No Personal Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    Vocab does not collect, store, or share any personal data from its users.
    The app operates entirely on-device and does not require any form of account,
    login, or personal information.
  </p>

  <h2>2. App Functionality</h2>
  <p>
    The application’s sole purpose is to display vocabulary content in a feed
    format and provide optional pronunciation playback. All data used within the
    app (such as words, meanings, settings, and preferences) is stored locally on
    the user’s device and never transmitted to any external server.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The app may use third-party services such as Google AdMob for showing
    advertisements. These services may collect certain data as described in their
    own privacy policies. You can review Google’s policies on their official
    website.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The app does not knowingly collect any data from children. Since Vocab
    collects no personal information, it is safe for all age groups.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally. Continued use of the app
    after changes indicates acceptance of the new version.
  </p>
